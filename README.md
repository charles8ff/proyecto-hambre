# üçî Project Hungry - Final Project 4GeeksAcademy üç¥
### Final Project with @charles8ff

In this project our goal is to give to local hostelry an easier and simple access to the digital world. Furthermore, we will bring visibility 
to those little establishments through our searchbar.

To achieve our goal, we reshape the traditional paper menus into a digital approach, including QR technology. Moreover, we will bring forward 
those businesses to new clients born into the digital world, by developing a search engine using our database that filters the different products
these refreshed establishments.
